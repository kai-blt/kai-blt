### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Brendan Lai-Tong and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer, professional musician and educator based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Both music and technology have been a huge part of my life and I really enjoy the creativity and problem solving that both hold in common. 

I attended Lambda School, an Immersive 6 month Full Stack Web Development program that provides hands on curriculum in the areas of HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, JavaScript, Node, Java, React, Python, Redux, and SQL.
